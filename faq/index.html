      <li>
        Didn't this app get shut down before?
      </h3>
      <p>Yeah, but we're good now. This version doesn't use username or password. It even got a thumbs-up from Divvy's legal team.</p>

      <li>
        Can you tell me about some excellent people who helped make DivvyBrags?
      </h3>
      <p>Why, sure. <a href="https://github.com/tothebeat">Nick Bennett</a> wrote super-slick Python scripts to find distances between Divvy stations. The good folks at the <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/">Smart Chicago Collaborative</a> lent us their Google Maps for Businesses license. Drew Huening had the idea for a browser extension. Hunter Owens and Dan Gohlke gave great advice, <a href="https://twitter.com/iandees">Ian Dees</a> wrote the very first divvybikes.com scraping tool, and &mdash; last but not least &mdash; the Divvy team (a.) took the time to review this app and (b.) built a great bikeshare system for Chicago.</p>
