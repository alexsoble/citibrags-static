        Didn't this app get shut down before?
      </h3>
      <p>Yeah... But we're all good now. Basically, Divvy didn't feel that the old version was secure for users (<a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20130926/south-loop/divvy-shuts-down-inventors-mileage-tracking-app">here's the full story</a>). The new DivvyBrags is a Chrome extension, so it doesn't ask for your username or password at any point. It even got a thumbs-up from Divvy's IT team and legal department. Thanks Divvy!</p>

        Can you tell me about some excellent people who helped make DivvyBrags?
      </h3>
      <p>Why, certainly. <a href="https://github.com/tothebeat">Nick Bennett</a> wrote super-slick Python scripts to find distances between Divvy stations. The good folks at the <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/">Smart Chicago Collaborative</a> lent us their Google Maps for Business license. Drew Huening had the idea for a browser extension. Hunter Owens and Dan Gohlke gave great advice. <a href="https://twitter.com/iandees">Ian Dees</a> wrote the first scraping tool for the Divvy website. Last but not least, the Divvy team (a.) took the time to review this app and (b.) built a great bikeshare system for Chicago.</p>

        How does DivvyBrags work?
      </h3>
      <p>For each trip, DivvyBrags finds the distance from Station A to Station B as measured by the <a href='https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distancematrix/'>Google Distance Matrix API</a> (cycling mode). The assumption is that you're using Divvy bikes to travel from station to station. DivvyBrags is actually providing a lower bound of sorts for your milage &mdash; if you check a bike out at Station A, bike around for 20 minutes, and then check it back in at Station A, your DivvyBrags milage count doesn't increase.</p>
